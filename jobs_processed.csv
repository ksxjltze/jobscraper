265,Jobs For Architectural Graduates,Ace PLP Pte Ltd,"Jobs For Architectural Graduates

Entry Requirements
Entry-level candidates and mid-careerists may apply. Strong interest in pursuing a career in the Built Environment Sector.
Degree/Diploma/ITE in Built Environment-related fields:
Aerospace Engineering
Architecture
Civil Engineering
Electrical Engineering
Green Building
Landscape Design & Planning
Mechanical Engineering
Mechatronic Engineering
Sustainable Building
Other qualifications considered: Any engineering subjects, Intelligent Building Technology, Graphic Arts, Visual/Product/Interior Design, Landscape Architecture, Environmental Engineering, etc.
Professionals with prior experience in BIM may request a skills test to fast-track their development at AcePLP.
Role Of An Architectural Engineer In AcePLP
Fresh Architectural graduates and mid-careerists with no prior work experience will complete 2 months of classroom training in BIM and CAD applications. The training is conducted by Ace Industry Academy (AIA), the official training arm of AcePLP, and will prepare you as you embark on your career as an Architectural BIM Modeller. AIA is an SSG/WSG approved training provider, and some modules which you attend during this period will be WSQ-accredited, and in line with the national skills framework for the Built Environment. (SSG/WSG is a statutory council formed by the Ministry of Manpower and Ministry of Education.)
Certificates will be awarded on completion of classroom training, and thereafter, you will be assigned to work on projects to gain experience. To guarantee a smooth transition, AcePLP pairs freshly trained BIM modellers with senior colleagues or Alumni. Trainers will also be on hand to assist the new modellers if they run into any challenges. The experience you gain from participating in projects can be used towards the Digital Delivery Management Accreditation Scheme.
You will likely assist our clients to populate Architecture BIM models with building components such as walls, columns, slab, floor, doors, windows, roof, staircase, ceiling, fixtures, and furniture items. Some of our colleagues in this type of projects also create room books; assigning spaces, zones and rooms to the facility and using it to create area plans and schedules.
As you learn and progress in the digital delivery services role, you may be moved into projects that require a great deal of integration and coordination with other stakeholders, as the role of design and construction is often a collaboration between consultants, contractors, and specialists.
What You Will Learn On The Job
In the 26-month AcePLP Career Advancement Programme, you start off in our classrooms to undergo intense technical training in BIM to build your foundational skills in Digital Delivery Management.
Through our training programme, we ensure that you gain the ability to use the most popularly used BIM software application in Singapore, which are Autodesk Revit, Bentley OpenBuilding, OpenRail and OpenPlant. This gives you the flexibility to work on various kinds of building and infrastructure projects in Singapore. We will also cover the use of 2D products such as AutoCAD and MicroStation, which are crucial for the documentation of the BIM models.
As and when the use cases arise, we will put you through training in 4D BIM products, combining the BIM application software with a Microsoft Projects or Primavera P6 schedule using products such as Synchro 4D or Navisworks Manage, enabling you to deliver on Virtual Design and Construction processes. You may undergo other types of training depending on your interest and where the opportunities take you.
What Is Your Career Progression As An Architectural BIM Modeller?
BIM has greatly improved how architects and engineers design and construct buildings. With BIM authoring tools, architects create a digital 3D model of the building, allowing them to see a representation of what it will look like and how it will operate. The ease of which designs can be updated according to new information and requirements allows the design process to become iterative, transforming the ways that Architects have traditionally operated.
Skills and experience in BIM have become a fundamental requirement for moving into and progressing within the Architecture track of the Built Environment. Your participation in our apprenticeship programme will help you open doors to many opportunities in the Architecture track.
Depending on the assignment opportunities, you may also have collaborated with structural and/or mechanical and electrical teams. This kind of experience can have a transformative effect on your career as an Architect, and on parallel, also set you for a career in Project Management.
If your interest lies in technology implementation, you will also have many opportunities within the Digital Delivery Management track, which involves the adoption and implementation of up-to-date emerging digital technologies to optimize operations and processes, improve collaboration and enhance work efficiency.
You can progress in this track to become an expert DDM professional, rising in the ranks to become a Tier 2 (Lead) BIM Manager, and then a Chief Digital Officer (Tier 1), where you will oversee the implementation and innovation of digital solutions to achieve digital transformation in the business, leading the strategic direction in your team.

272,Jobs For Landscape Architecture Graduates,Ace PLP Pte Ltd,"Jobs For Landscape Architecture Graduates
Entry Requirements
Entry-level candidates and mid-careerists may apply. Strong interest in pursuing a career in the Built Environment Sector.
Degree/Diploma/ITE in Built Environment-related fields:
Aerospace Engineering
Architecture
Civil Engineering
Electrical Engineering
Green Building
Landscape Design & Planning
Mechanical Engineering
Mechatronic Engineering
Sustainable Building
Other qualifications considered: Any engineering subjects, Intelligent Building Technology, Graphic Arts, Visual/Product/Interior Design, Landscape Architecture, Environmental Engineering, etc.
Professionals with prior experience in BIM may request a skills test to fast-track their development at AcePLP.
Role Of A Landscape Architecture In AcePLP
Fresh Landscape Architecture graduates and mid-careerists with no prior work experience will complete 2 months of classroom training in BIM and CAD applications. The training is conducted by Ace Industry Academy (AIA), the official training arm of AcePLP, and will prepare you as you embark on your career as a Landscape Architecture BIM modeller. AIA is an SSG/WSG approved training provider, and some modules which you attend during this period will be WSQ-accredited, and in line with the national skills framework for the Built Environment. (SSG/WSG is a statutory council formed by the Ministry of Manpower and Ministry of Education.)
Certificates will be awarded on completion of classroom training, and thereafter, you will be assigned to work on projects to gain experience. To guarantee a smooth transition, AcePLP pairs freshly trained BIM Modellers with senior colleagues or Alumni. Trainers will also be on hand to assist the new modellers if they run into any challenges. The experience you gain from participating in projects can be used towards the Digital Delivery Management Accreditation Scheme.
Using BIM for landscape architecture allows us to take ownership of the designs and enable confident decision-making. It designs with data instead of simply relying on geometry or 2D lines. For example, a tree within a BIM model would have the parameters necessary to install the tree, such as its scientific name, root size, condition and install height. It should also have relevant design information such as the mature height, spread, water and sun requirements, and bloom time.
In your projects, you will serve clients that are main contractors that need to interface with Architects, or support our clients work in Architecture practice. You may also be assigned to work at multi-disciplinary engineering consultancies with Architecture departments.
You will likely assist our clients to populate Landscape Architecture BIM models, work with digital terrain models, import or build tree elements, create slopes, curbs, pavements and surface drainage elements in the Landscape Architecture BIM model, and produce schedules, reports, and worksheets that are linked to geometry to create a bi-directional link between the BIM model and the documentation.
As you learn and progress in the digital delivery services role, you may be moved into assignments that require a great deal of integration and coordination with other stakeholders, because the role of design and construction is often a collaboration between consultants, contractors, and specialists.
What You Will Learn On The Job
In the 26-month AcePLP Career Advancement Programme, you start off in our classrooms to undergo intense technical training in BIM to build your foundational skills in Digital Delivery Management.

Through our training programme, we ensure that you gain the ability to use the most popularly used BIM application software in Singapore, which are Autodesk Revit, Bentley OpenBuilding, OpenRail and OpenPlant. This gives you the flexibility to work on various kinds of building and infrastructure projects in Singapore. We will also cover the use of 2D products such as AutoCAD and MicroStation, which are crucial for the documentation of the BIM models.

Occasionally, Autodesk Civil 3D is used in civil infrastructure projects. As an extension to AutoCAD, Civil 3D has a similar interface which builds on top of AutoCAD capabilities to generate 3D models for surfaces, alignments, profiles, assemblies, and corridors. As when opportunity arises, we will put you through training in 4D BIM products, combining the BIM model with a Microsoft Projects or Primavera P6 schedule using products such as Synchro 4D or Navisworks Manage, enabling you to deliver on Virtual Design and Construction processes. You may undergo other types of training depending on your interest and where the opportunities take you.
What Is Your Career Progression As A Landscape Architecture Graduate?
BIM has greatly improved how architects and engineers design and construct buildings. With BIM authoring tools, architects create a digital 3D model of the building, allowing them to see a representation of what it will look like and how it will operate. The ease of which designs can be updated according to new information and requirements allows the design process to become iterative, transforming the ways that Architects have traditionally operated.

Skills and experience in BIM have become a fundamental requirement for moving into and progressing into Architecture jobs in the Built Environment. Your participation in our apprenticeship programme will help you open doors to many job opportunities in Landscape Architecture.

Depending on the assignment opportunities, you may also have collaborated with structural and/or mechanical and electrical teams. This kind of experience can have a transformative effect on your career as an Architect, and on parallel, also set you for a career in Project Management.

If your interest lies in technology implementation, you will also have many opportunities to jobs in Digital Delivery Management, which involves the adoption and implementation of up-to-date emerging digital technologies to optimize operations and processes, improve collaboration and enhance work efficiency.

You can progress in this track to become an expert DDM professional, rising in the ranks to become a Tier 2 (Lead) BIM Manager, and then a Chief Digital Officer (Tier 1), where you will oversee the implementation and innovation of digital solutions to achieve digital transformation in the business, leading the strategic direction in your team.

With a domain knowledge grounded in construction through the experience in projects, armed with a spatial awareness via your 3D modelling and visualization skills, you can enter other tracks to continue to build domain expertise and experience.

Sustainable Building
Other qualifications considered: Any engineering subjects, Intelligent Building Technology, Graphic Arts, Visual/Product/Interior Design, Landscape Architecture, Environmental Engineering, etc.
Professionals with prior experience in BIM may request a skills test to fast-track their development at AcePLP.
Role Of An Electrical Engineer In AcePLP
Fresh Electrical Engineering graduates and mid-careerists with no prior work experience will complete 2 months of classroom training in BIM and CAD applications. The training is conducted by Ace Industry Academy (AIA), the official training arm of AcePLP, and will prepare you as you embark on your career as a Electrical BIM Engineer. AIA is an SSG/WSG approved training provider, and some modules which you attend during this period will be WSQ-accredited, and in line with the national skills framework for the Built Environment. (SSG/WSG is a statutory council formed by the Ministry of Manpower and Ministry of Education.)
Certificates will be awarded on completion of classroom training, and thereafter, you will be assigned to work on electrical engineering-related projects to gain experience. To guarantee a smooth transition, AcePLP pairs freshly trained BIM engineers with senior colleagues or Alumni. Trainers will also be on hand to assist the new Engineers if they run into any challenges. The experience you gain from participating in projects can be used towards the Digital Delivery Management Accreditation Scheme.
As an electrical engineering graduate, your role in the projects will include serving clients that are main contractors with mechanical and electrical (M&E) departments, or you may be assigned to work with offices that provide engineering design and consultancy services, creating data-rich BIM models. With BIM, contractors can build electrical 3D BIM models of power supply, lighting, duct banks, power feeders, branch circuits and more.
This entry-level engineering job is ideal for new graduates, but as you learn and progress in the digital delivery services role, you may be moved into assignments that require a great deal of integration and coordination with other stakeholders, because the role of design and construction is often a collaboration between consultants, contractors, and specialists.
Coordinated BIM models in this area can be used to avoid material waste, rework, and better plan the execution of the project. Add-ons to popular BIM tools such as Revit can help produce automated detailing of shop drawings.
What You Will Learn On The Job
In the 26-month AcePLP Career Advancement Programme, you start off in our classrooms to undergo intense technical training in BIM to build your foundational skills in Digital Delivery Management.

Through our training programme, we ensure that you gain the ability to use the most popularly used BIM application software in Singapore, which are Autodesk Revit, Bentley OpenBuilding, OpenRail and OpenPlant. This gives you the flexibility to work on various kinds of building and infrastructure projects in Singapore. We will also cover the use of 2D products such as AutoCAD and MicroStation, which are crucial for the documentation of the BIM models.

As when opportunity arises, we will put you through training in 4D BIM products, combining the BIM model with a Microsoft Projects or Primavera P6 schedule using products such as Synchro 4D or Navisworks Manage, enabling you to deliver on Virtual Design and Construction processes. You may undergo other types of training depending on your interest and where the opportunities take you.
Career Progression As An Electrical Engineering Professional
The Digital Delivery Management track involves the adoption and implementation of up-to-date emerging digital technologies to optimize operations and processes, improve collaboration and enhance work efficiency.

You can progress in this track to become an expert DDM professional, rising in the ranks to become a Tier 2 (Lead) BIM Manager, where you will play leading roles in project delivery, digital solutions and adoption, competency building and innovation to organisations or project teams in the Built Environment.

At the height of your career in the DDM (BIM) track, you can aspire to be a Chief Digital Officer (Tier 1), a C-suite role where you will oversee the implementation and innovation of digital solutions to achieve digital transformation in the business, leading the strategic direction in your team.

Alternatively, you can move into other tracks in the Built Environment that is of interest to you, such as in Architecture, Engineering Design and Consultancy, Construction and/or Project Management. With a domain knowledge grounded in construction through the experience in projects, armed with a spatial awareness via your 3D modelling and visualization skills, you can enter other tracks to continue to build domain expertise and experience.

Within the Electrical Engineering domain, you have built an advantage in using the BIM to enhance productivity as you will use your skills for clash detection, change management, data management, and simulations of building performance in all of your future projects.

Role Of An Aerospace Graduates In AcePLP
Fresh Aerospace graduates and mid-careerists with no prior work experience will complete 2 months of classroom training in BIM and CAD applications. The training is conducted by Ace Industry Academy (AIA), the official training arm of AcePLP, and will prepare you as you embark on your career as a Aerospace BIM Engineers. AIA is an SSG/WSG approved training provider, and some modules which you attend during this period will be WSQ-accredited, and in line with the national skills framework for the Built Environment. (SSG/WSG is a statutory council formed by the Ministry of Manpower and Ministry of Education.)
Certificates will be awarded on completion of classroom training, and thereafter, you will be assigned to work on projects to gain experience. To guarantee a smooth transition, AcePLP pairs freshly trained BIM Engineers with senior colleagues or Alumni. Trainers will also be on hand to assist the new engineers if they run into any challenges. The experience you gain from participating in projects can be used towards the Digital Delivery Management Accreditation Scheme.
Some of our best talent at AcePLP start with a diploma in aerospace engineering. Their abilities and knowledge in math, engineering and technology help them to excel in our line of work. They incorporate knowledge of the Built Environment into their broad-based understanding of the design, construction and maintenance of aircraft, spacecraft, and equipment systems.
