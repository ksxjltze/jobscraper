"Frontend Engineer, Platform",DATATURE PTE. LTD.,"$6,000 - $7,500 a month","About the job
At Datature, we are building a platform for training and deploying machine learning models swiftly without a single line of code. Datature Nexus is an MLOps platform that allows users to label unstructured data and construct complex machine learning pipelines all in their browser using highly visual editors.
Our users have leveraged our platform to solve problems in a myriad of verticals - from grading crops to optimizing manufacturing to identifying diseases from MRI scans. Datature levels the playing field for teams and companies in most industries to start AI-driven revolutions of their own.
The Scope
Datature's platform features multiple visual editors that convert raw, unstructured data to highly performant machine learning models. This requires a handful of services to work together seamlessly. You will be working with us on front-end interfaces such as our visual editor, image annotator tools, and solving problems with ReactJS, LeafletJS, Computational Geometry, and Large Data Rendering (2D/3D)
Our annotator is written primarily in Typescript and rendered with a combination of LeafletJS, WebGL, and other Computer Vision algorithms. Working with unstructured data is hard, but rendering them is harder - you will be working on building performant web components that will change the way machine learning engineers build on our platform.

Requirements
Minimum 2+ Years Experience in Engineering Frontend Applications
Experienced in TypeScript , ReactJS , Redux , NextJS and CSS3
Strong understanding of the React Virtual DOM and Lifecycles
Knowledge of modern authorization mechanisms, such as JSON Web Tokens
[Required] Experience Working with Interactive Components using Canvas API, LeafletJS , D3js or other graphically interactive projects
Experience with REST APIs, GraphQL and WebSockets
Interest in Building UI with Performance, Accessibility and Scalability In Mind
Experience with Cypress or other React/Frontend Testing Libraries
Knowledge in Graph Algorithms is a plus and Computational Geometry is ❤️
Having a knack for designing great UI and user journeys is always appreciated
About You
You don't need to have a Bachelor's or Masters of Computer Science to write great software. We are looking for a frontend guru who has built products that have shaped the lives of users and have a portfolio of meaningful side projects. If you have personal projects to flex or show us, it tells a better story than putting up a wall of 34 skills in the CV.
That said, we are looking for someone with a niche set of skills who can work on advanced rendering techniques and frameworks, leveraging front-end technologies.
Why You'll Love Us
We are a technology-first team dedicated to developing the most intuitive and performant platform to shape the way users think about building machine learning capabilities. We are a quirky group of engineers that you will enjoy debating about codes and algorithms with. Gone are the days where you have to build yet another internal CRUD tool.
You will be solving the most important problems at the intersection of machine learning, design, and computational geometry. You will have the largest impact on how users feel and navigate the journey from end to end on our platform.
If this is your cup of tea, we would love to hear from you.
Do include links to previous projects, GitHub profiles, or any links that might help us learn more about you.","$6,000 - $7,500 a month - Full-time"

About us
Dyson is a global technology enterprise. We solve the problems others choose to ignore, with surprising new inventions that defy convention and simply work better. We’ve been developing robot technology for over 20 years – 200 engineers, 420 patents and £28M of investments – but this is just the start of the domestic robotics revolution.
Within Upstream Robotics, Research is investigating state-of-the-art methods to solve concrete real-world problems and pave the way for Dyson’s future autonomous products. At the same time, New Product Innovation is developing Dyson’s next-generation robotic products that leverage the latest technologies.
Our world-class robotics team is highly multi-disciplinary, covering topics including Robot Perception, Reinforcement and Imitation Learning, Planning and Control, Task Intelligence, Software Architecture, Mechatronics and Platform Design within a friendly and multi-cultural work environment.
About the role
As a member of Upstream Robotics’ Software & DevOps team, you’ll design, implement, maintain and extend components of our software platform, support its users, integrate new functionality and take on the occasional proof-of-concept or exploration task. You’ll be collaborating closely with immediate team members, Upstream domain experts and Downstream colleagues. This is an opportunity to play a key role in continuously improving the architecture, practices and tooling with the goal of accelerating research and development, closing the gap to production and shortening time-to-market.
As a Senior Software Engineer, you are expected to:
Have a solid understanding of core development concepts and best practices
Work with focus, attention to detail and consideration of system-wide implications
Deliver tasks effectively to specification, on agreed time and with little assistance, but know when to seek clarifications, help or feedback
Demonstrate a continuous learning mindset, act on feedback and strive to improve our platform and its utility to users
Communicate with the wider team proactively, minding efficiency and quality of conversations
Mentor and support junior team members in technical and ways-of-working matters and create a positive and engaging team environment
Responsibilities:
Design, implement, test, maintain and evolve functional components and tools of our software platform
Integrate third-party components and implement new system behaviours
Port select research prototypes in Python or C++ to modern, robust C++ implementations
Help manage the entire high-level software stack, including the operating system, device drivers and user interfaces
Participate in the design of a distributed system software architecture that is scalable and deployable
Meticulously document and communicate software requirements, design and implementation
Drive a culture of software quality and collaboration that can progressively become the norm across the group
About you
Required:
Degree in engineering or equivalent industry experience
3+ years of work experience with robotic, actuated, real-time or simulated physical systems
Strong object-oriented and functional programming skills in modern C++
Working knowledge of a scripting language such as Python or Bash
Good knowledge and hands-on experience with Linux system and toolchains
Proficient use of development best practices and tools including version control, unit testing, continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD)
Ability to break down problems, estimate development effort and prioritise work
Habit of exercising engineering precision
Beneficial:
Professional software development experience in a production environment
Significant contributions to open-source projects
Experience inspecting, debugging, testing and profiling complex software systems
Experience with parallel programming and performance optimisation
Experience with ONNXRuntime, TensorRT, CVflow, RKNN or deployment to NPU-based platforms
Experience with profiling and optimizing machine learning models for target hardware
Experience making real robots or autonomous systems work robustly in the field
Experience with ROS 2, DDS-based middleware systems and messaging frameworks
Experience with simulation environments such as Unity or Isaac Sim and simulation at scale in the cloud
Experience with Yocto/BitBake based build systems
Experience with containerised development and deployment
Experience with behaviour planning and decision making architectures
Benefits
Dyson Singapore monitors the market to ensure competitive salaries and bonuses. Beyond that, you’ll enjoy a transport allowance and comprehensive medical care and insurance. But financial benefits are just the start of a Dyson career. Professional growth, leadership development and new opportunities abound, driven by regular reviews and dynamic workshops. And with a vibrant culture, the latest devices and a relaxed dress code reflecting our engineering spirit, it’s an exciting team environment geared to fuelling and realising ambition.

About us
Dyson is a global technology enterprise. We solve the problems others choose to ignore, with surprising new inventions that defy convention and simply work better. We’ve been developing robot technology for over 20 years – 200 engineers, 420 patents and £28M of investments – but this is just the start of the domestic robotics revolution.
Within Upstream Robotics, Research is investigating state-of-the-art methods to solve concrete real-world problems and pave the way for Dyson’s future autonomous products. At the same time, New Product Innovation is developing Dyson’s next-generation robotic products that leverage the latest technologies.
Our world-class robotics team is highly multi-disciplinary, covering topics including Robot Perception, Reinforcement and Imitation Learning, Planning and Control, Task Intelligence, Software Architecture, Mechatronics and Platform Design within a friendly and multi-cultural work environment.
About the role
As a member of Upstream Robotics’ Software & DevOps team, you’ll design, implement, maintain and extend components of our software platform, support its users, integrate new functionality and take on the occasional proof-of-concept or exploration task. You’ll be collaborating closely with immediate team members, Upstream domain experts and Downstream colleagues. This is an opportunity to play a key role in continuously improving the architecture, practices and tooling with the goal of accelerating research and development, closing the gap to production and shortening time-to-market.
As a Senior Software Engineer, you are expected to:
Have a solid understanding of core development concepts and best practices
Work with focus, attention to detail and consideration of system-wide implications
Deliver tasks effectively to specification, on agreed time and with little assistance, but know when to seek clarifications, help or feedback
Demonstrate a continuous learning mindset, act on feedback and strive to improve our platform and its utility to users
Communicate with the wider team proactively, minding efficiency and quality of conversations
